# Collatz Conjecture in java
This demonstrates the collatz conjecture. Run the collatz.jar file with this command: 
```
java -jar collatz.jar <number>
```
You can replace ```<number>``` with any number you want.
Here is example of the output when you run the file and you replace ```<number>``` with 20.
```
20.0
10.0
5.0
16.0
8.0
4.0
2.0
1.0
```
How about 50?

I think you can see a pattern here. If you don't, I will tell you: the rsult always ends with one. Try it.
You can view the source code and download the .jar file as well. Enjoy! This was made using the IntelliJ IDE from jetbrains.
